                <p>Capybaras are mammals that evolved from the Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris.</p>
                <p>The capybara species were discovered in Africa over 80 million years ago before it made its journey to South America 40 million years later.</p>
                <p>Our first illustration shows the present-day capybara with long fur, small legs, and small ears.</p>
                <p>These features allow the animal to adapt to their natural environment as they spend a large amount of time in water and swamps</p>

            <h2>Popularity and Meme culture</h2>
            <p>In the early 2020s, capybaras became a growing figure of meme culture due to many factors, including the disturbances in Nordelta which led to them being comically postulated as figures of class struggle.</p>
            <p>Also, a common meme format includes capybaras in various situations with the song "After Party" by Don Toliver, leading to a tremendous growth in popularity.</p>
            <p>Due to a lyric in Toliver's song, capybaras are also associated with the phrase "Ok I pull up".</p>
