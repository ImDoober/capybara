                    <p>Capybaras eat a mix of aquatic vegetation, grasses, barks, tubers, sugar cane and plant roots.</p>
                    <p>They need to eat a lot because they have a limited ability to store fat in their bodies. </p>
                    <p>In fact, capybaras can’t go for long periods of time without food and can undergo periods of starvation if they don’t find enough food to eat on a consistent basis. </p>
                    <p>The capybara has a four-chamber stomach that allows them to digest tough plant materials that humans can’t digest easily. </p>
                    <p>In addition, this multi-chambered stomach is extremely efficient at pulling out nutrients from plans.</p>
                    <p>They are very selective feeders and feed on the leaves of one species and disregard other species surrounding it.</p>
                    <p>They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available.</p>
                    <p>While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.</p>
                    <p>Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so they are not consumed at that time.</p>
