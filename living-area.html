                    <p>Capybaras are found in Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Peru, Brazil, Paraguay, Northeast Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
                    <p>They are semi-aquatic and will spend most of their time in dense vegetation around rivers, lakes, ponds, marshes and swamps.</p>
                    <p>Feeding mostly in the afternoon, and on and off at night, capybaras tend to doze in the morning.</p>
                    <p>They take short naps throughout the day while other members of their group stand guard.</p>
                    <p>They are superb swimmers and can hold their breath underwater for up to five minutes at a time. Capybara have flourished in cattle ranches.</p>
                    <p>roam in home ranges averaging 10 hectares (25 acres) in high-density populations.</p>

            <h2>Predators</h2>
            <p>Capybaras are naturally threatened by jaguars, caimans and anacondas, and their young can be taken by ocelots and harpy eagles.</p> 
            <p>Their main threat, however, is humans â€” they are hunted extensively for their meat and their hide, which can be made into leather.</p>
            <p>In some countries, the practice of farming capybaras has sprung up, relieving some of the pressure on wild populations.</p>
            <p>As with all rainforest inhabitants, deforestation also poses a threat.</p>
