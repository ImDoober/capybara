                        <p>The capybara or greater capybara <em>(Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris)</em> is a giant cavy rodent native to South America.</p>
                        <p>It is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the lesser capybara <em>(Hydrochoerus isthmius).</em></p>
                        <p>Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. </p>
                        <p>The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals.</p>
                        <p>The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin. It is not considered a threatened species.</p>

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>Its common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination of kaá (leaf) + píi (slender) + ú (eat) + ara (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater".</p>
                <p> scientific name, both hydrochoerus and hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χοῖρος (choiros "pig, hog")</p>

                <h2>Classification and phylogeny</h2>
                <p>The capybara and the lesser capybara both belong to the subfamily Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies.</p>
                <p>The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae.</p>
                <p>Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the rock cavies, supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae.</p>
